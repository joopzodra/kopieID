# KopieID

With this app you can hide you're personal number on copies of identity papers, like a passport, so the person receiving the copy can't misuse you're personal number. And add a watermark to the copy.

- Upload an image of your identity card (ID).
- Draw one or more lines with the mouse or finger. (You can adjust the line width.)
- Change the watermarkt text if you like.
- Download the new copy of your ID.

The app works on every image: you can draw straight black lines on any images and add a watermark. 

The app uses several html-canvasses: one for the image, two canvas for drawing the strike-through line and one for the watermark text. Before downloading, these are merged.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Angular
The app is made with Angular 5. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.
